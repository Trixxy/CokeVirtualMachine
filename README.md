# Coke Virtual Machine
This project started as part of the compiler construction course held by Philipp Haller at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). 

The idea was to implement a simple virtual machine similar to the JVM, but quickly escalated to follow the JVM specification.

This project should not be interpreted as a try to implement a JVM, it is just me trying to get a deeper understanding of how things work.

In its current state, the code is just a big mess.
